Kivy Examples
=============

To install Kivy on Ubuntu 14.04, refer to the following script: https://github.com/brousch/kivy-installer/blob/master/ubuntu/1404/python27/kivy_all.sh

There's no need to go through the PPA as per the official installation instructions.

To build any of these programs for your Android device, run the following command and transfer the resulting .apk file to your device. I usually just drag it into a Dropbox folder and open it from my phone.

```
buildozer -v android debug
```
